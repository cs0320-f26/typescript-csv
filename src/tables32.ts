/**
 * We want the library to give users a _handle_ to data, not the data directly.
 * We also want to ensure that handles can't be forged: if a caller has a
 * handle, it must have come from this module, and not just accidentally align.
 * So strings, numbers, and so on are very bad handles!
 *
 * We don't export this symbol, so it's very hard to accidentally forge it.
 *
 * Why not a string? Because s1 === s2 returns true if the strings have the same
 * content, even if they are different references. But symbols are raw
 * references, so harder to accidentally forge.
 *
 * Why "unique"? It has to do with the specifics of what [_Key] means. Without
 * "unique", the typechecker doesn't have enough information: as far as it
 * knows, any symbol would work.
